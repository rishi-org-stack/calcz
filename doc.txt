Lexical Analysis
1. break down byte stream into token
2. load token stream into equal sized buffer
3. token is pre-defined seq of character that can not be broken down futher.
4. lexeme a patter of token is lexem
5. identify lexem using fat and slow pointer in the buffer
6. if a given lexeme does not match a pattern its lexical error
